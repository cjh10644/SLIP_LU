This is the code associated with the paper 
"Exact Solution of Sparse Linear Systems via Left-looking Roundoff-Error-Free LU Factorization in Time Proportional 
 to Arithmetic Work"
 published in SIMAX.

This is a version 0.1 of the SLIP LU code, a full release of SLIP LU
is expected to come in fall 2019.
