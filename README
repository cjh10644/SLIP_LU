This is the code associated with the paper 
"Asymptotically Optimal Exact Solution of Sparse Linear Systems via Left-looking Roundoff-Error-Free LU Factorization"
submitted to SIMAX.

This is a preliminary version of the SLIP LU code, a full release is to come and this will be updated to document this.
