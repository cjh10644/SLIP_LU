TODO: delete this file before releasing the code

Changes made for 4/29/19

Note: I wasn't able to test these since code not curently working, but if there are any issues, let me know 
and I will fix

1) SLIP_create_dense function in source and include (needs to be added to makefile)

2) SLIP_delete_dense function in source and include (needs to be added to makefile)

3) Put the SLIP_dense data structure into the following functions. Note that some
   of the names have changed, that needs to be looked at in the renaming pass. Any 
   function I edited I also renamed in source (but not necessarily in all functions
   that use it). Also, those which have been renamed need to be modified in the makefile.
        a) SLIP_check_solution (renamed from SLIP_LU_check)
        b) SLIP_solve_double (renamed from SLIP_LU_double)
        c) SLIP_solve_mpfr (renamed from SLIP_LU_mpfr)
        d) SLIP_solve_mpq (renamed from SLIP_LU_mpq)
        e) SLIP_LU_analyze (renamed from SLIP_LU_symbolic)
        f) SLIP_permute_x (renamed from SLIP_Permute_x)
        g) SLIP_read_rhs
        h) SLIP_LU_solve (renamed from SLIP_Solve)
        i) slip_UMFPACK_permute
        
4) Removed LU scale, b scale, and determinant from options, SLIP_create_option and SLIP_delete_option

5) Added A->scale to SLIP_create_mat, SLIP_delete_mat, SLIP_create_dense, SLIP_delete_dense

6) Fixed scale in:
        a) slip_expand_double_array
        b) slip_expand_double_mat
        c) slip_expand_mpfr_array
        d) slip_expand_mpfr_mat
        e) slip_expand_mpq_array
        f) slip_expand_mpq_mat
    
7) SLIP_build_mat_ccf has been broken into 5 versions:
        a) SLIP_build_sparse_ccf_mpz
        b) SLIP_build_sparse_ccf_doub
        c) SLIP_build_sparse_ccf_int
        d) SLIP_build_sparse_ccf_mpq
        e) SLIP_build_sparse_ccf_mpfr
        
8) SLIP_build_mat_trip has been broken into 5 versions
        a) SLIP_build_sparse_trip_mpz
        b) SLIP_build_sparse_trip_doub
        c) SLIP_build_sparse_trip_int
        d) SLIP_build_sparse_trip_mpq
        e) SLIP_build_sparse_trip_mpfr
        
9) SLIP_triplet destoryed in the code. The function SLIP_trip_to_mat was fixed. The following functions were removed:
        a) SLIP_create_trip
        b) SLIP_delete_trip
        
10) SLIP_read_matrix and SLIP_read_matrix_double had the SLIP_trip data type removed.

11) SLIP_build_rhs has been transformed into 5 functions:
        a) SLIP_build_dense_double
        a) SLIP_build_dense_int
        a) SLIP_build_dense_mpz
        a) SLIP_build_dense_mpq
        a) SLIP_build_dense_mpfr
